	 * 		a) If the salary is less than 10,000 the rank is 20
	 * 		b) If the salary is less than 50,000 the rank is 40
	 * 		c) If the salary is less than 100,000 the rank is 60
	 * 		d) More or equal than 100,000 the rank is 80
	 * 2. Warnings determine a penalty on the awarded rank,
	 * 	  the penalties are the following:
	 * 		a) If the employee has no warnings the rank is not decreased 
	 * 		b) If the employee has 1 warning the rank is decreased by 5
	 * 		c) If the employee has 2 warnings the rank is decreased by 10
	 * 		d) If the employee has 3 warnings the rank is decreased by 15 
	 * 		e) If the warnings are more than 3 the decrease is determined 
	 * 		   by the next equation: totalDecrease = warnings*6
	 * @param person 
	 * @return (currentRank - warningDeRank)
